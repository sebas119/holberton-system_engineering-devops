## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

---

### [0. ARP spoofing and sniffing unencrypted traffic](./0-sniffing)
* 


### [1. Dictionary attack](./1-dictionary_attack)
* Password-based authentication systems can be easily broken by using a dictionary attack (you’ll have to find your own password dictionary). Let’s try it on an SSH account.
