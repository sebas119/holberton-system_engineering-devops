# Nginx installation script

# Requirements:

# Install nginx on your web server ubuntu 16.04
# Nginx should be listening on port 80
# When querying Nginx at its root / with a GET request (requesting a page) using curl, it must return a page that contains the string Holberton School
apt-get update
apt-get install nginx -y
# This profile opens only port 80 (normal, unencrypted web traffic)
ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'
echo "Holberton School" > /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html
service nginx start
